## 1. Introduction - Agenda

- Time and clocks
- Lan port diagrams
- Network models
- Causality and happens-before
- State and events

## 2. Time and Clocks

### **Uses of Time in Software**

- **Scheduling:**Â Setting start/end times (e.g., class schedules, assignment deadlines).
- **Marking Points in Time:**Â Timestamps (e.g., error logs, cache expiration).
- **Measuring Durations:**Â Time intervals (e.g., request timeouts, class duration).

### **Types of Clocks**

1. **Time-of-Day Clocks (Wall Clocks)**
    - Reflect current real-world time (e.g.,Â `2025-04-09 14:30:00`).
    - **Issues:**Â Can jump forward/backward (due to **Network Time Protocol** sync, daylight savings).
    - **Not ideal for measuring durations**Â due to potential inconsistencies.
2. **Monotonic Clocks**
    - Measure elapsed time since an arbitrary point (e.g., machine boot time).
    - Always increment, never jump backward.
    - **Good for measuring intervals**Â (e.g., timeouts).
    - **Limitation:**Â Values are **machine-specific**, not comparable across systems.

| Physical clocks | Points in time | Intervals/durations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time-of-day clocks | ðŸ˜• | ðŸ˜Ÿ |
| Monotonic clocks | ðŸ˜Ÿ | ðŸ˜ƒ |

### **Real-World Example: Cloudflare Bug (2016)**

- Used a time-of-day clock instead of a monotonic clock, causing issues due to clock adjustments.

## **3. Physical vs. Logical Clocks**

### **Physical Clocks (Time-of-Day & Monotonic)**

- **Problem:**Â Even with NTP sync, clocks drift, leading to inconsistencies.
- **Solution:**Â UseÂ **logical clocks**Â to order events rather than measure absolute time.

### **Logical Clocks**

- Focus onÂ **event ordering**Â rather than exact time.
- Key question:Â **Did event A happen before event B?**Â (A â†’ B)
    - What does this tell me about causality?
        - A could have caused B
        - B could not have caused A

## **4. Causality and Happens-Before Relation**

### **Definition**

- **Happens-Before (â†’):**Â A partial order of events in a distributed system.
    - If A and B are on theÂ **same process**, and A occurs before B, thenÂ **A â†’ B**.
    - If A is aÂ **send**Â and B is the correspondingÂ **receive**, thenÂ **A â†’ B**.
    - **Transitivity:**Â IfÂ **A â†’ B**Â andÂ **B â†’ C**, thenÂ **A â†’ C**.

### **Lamport (Space-Time) Diagrams**

- **Processes:**Â Represented as vertical lines.
- **Events:**Â Dots on process lines (internal, send, or receive events).
- **Messages:**Â Arrows between processes.

### **Example: Causal Anomaly (Alice, Bob, Carol)**

- Alice sends a message to Bob.
- Bob replies rudely before Carol receives Aliceâ€™s message.
- **Result:**Â Carol sees Bobâ€™s reply first (violates causality).

## **5. Network Models**

### **Synchronous Networks**

There is an **n** such that no message takes longer than **n units of time** to be delivered

- **Fixed upper bound**Â on message delivery time.
- Predictable butÂ **unrealistic**Â in practice.

### **Asynchronous Networks**

- **No upper bound**Â on message latency.
- More realistic but harder to design for (must handle unbounded delays).
- **Preferred model**Â for robust protocol design.

### **Partially Synchronous Networks**

- Upper bound exists but isÂ **unknown**Â in advance.
- Useful for verification but not commonly used in practice.

## **6. State and Events**

### **State**

- Represents a machineâ€™s knowledge (e.g., memory, registers).
- Determined byÂ **all prior events**Â up to that point.

### **Events**

- CanÂ **modify state**Â (e.g., variable assignment, message receipt).
- **Not all events affect state**Â (e.g., read-only operations).
- **Challenge:**Â Cannot infer event history from state alone.
